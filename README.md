# State Voting Precinct Files for BigQuery & Data Studio

Repo for 2020 state voting precincts.  Each state shapefile has been converted into a pseudo-GeoJSON CSV file so that it can be uploaded to BigQuery or used in Google Sheets. This file format can be used with the Data Studio Community Visualization [Choromap](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/4617cbac-3514-4c8d-a999-a3cb6683e579/page/N9GUB) built by [Michael Hodge](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/community-visualizations/tree/main/choromap) to easily map election outcomes.
